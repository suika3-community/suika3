System Menu
===========

## SysBtn

Suika3 features a hamburger menu button, typically located in the
top-left corner of the screen. This button is internally referred to
as the `System Button (SysBtn)`.

To ensure compliance with App Store guidelines, Suika3 avoids placing
small, PC-style buttons around the message window, adopting a
mobile-first approach instead. The SysBtn consists of two images and
associated animations. For a seamless user experience, the button is
responsive: it appears upon mouse movement or touch and automatically
hides after a few seconds of inactivity. While this behavior is
hard-coded for store compliance, the SysBtn can be completely
disabled—for instance, for demos or Kiosk mode—by setting
`sysbtn.enable=false` in the config.

While the absence of buttons around the familiar message window may
feel unexpected at first, we hope you'll understand that this
evolution is essential for adapting visual novels to modern mobile
platforms.
