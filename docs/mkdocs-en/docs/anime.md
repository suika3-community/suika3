Anime
=====

Anime is a feature to play layer-based animations by the [@anime](reference.html#anime) command.

## Anime File

An anime file is a text file which describes "sequences" of layer transforms.

## Sequence

To move the message box 100px right in a second, write the following sequence in an anime file.

```
move {
    # This is a layer specifier.
    layer: msg;

    # These are time specifiers. (in second)
    start: 0.0;
    end: 1.0;

    # These are origin position specifiers. 'r0' means relative '0'.
    from-x: r0;
    from-y: r0;

    # This is an origin alpha specifier.
    from-a: 255;

    # These are final position specifiers. 'r100' means relative '100'.
    to-x: r100;
    to-y: r0;

    # This is a final alpha specifier.
    to-a: 255;
}
```

## Layer Structure

The following is our layer structure.
