### Description

A feature to lauch a game by double-clicking a `start.novel` file on File Explorer.

### Outline of The Discussion

Background:
- To put a copy of `suika3.exe` file into a game folder is considered
  an extra step for file management on a game development because
  binary files are usually excluded in the Git repository.
- Launching a game by opening a `start.novel` file is a usuful feature
  in this context.

Concerns:
- None

### Notes on Progress

- 2026-04-28: Agreed to implement in the next feature-add window for 27.07 LTS.

### Description

Data Layer: Continue using save.thumb.width / save.thumb.height to control the actual screenshot resolution.
Display Layer: Allow explicit declaration of width and height within the Save Button (or UI component).
Rendering Logic: The engine should automatically scale (stretch/shrink) the "Original Thumbnail" to fit the declared "Display Size".
