### Report

Cannot play video files after a rendering.
Playing a video at the very first frame seems okay.

### Analysis

StratoHAL reused the main HWND of Direct3D 12 rendering to Media
Foundation EVR playback. However, once Direct3D swapchain is created
for the HWND, it cannot be shared with EVR.

### Patch

Added a rendering child HWND and a video child HWND.

### Report

If DirectShow is used for a video playback, the aspect ratio is wrong.

### Analysis

StratoHAL lacked the code for aspect ratio adjustment.

### Patch

Added a logic to StratoHAL.

## Font color is wrong

* Report Details
    * ID: BUG-20260316-001
    * Status: Resolved
    * Component: StratoHAL / image / glyph
    * Severity: high
    * Priority: high
    * Reproducibility: always
    * First Found In: 6fda2bb1cf9155e0616043f5040f9793db3e8276
    * Fixed In: 82f0e0e86e3349269bf95a809b0a061eebc5cf40
    * Reported Date: 03:00 16 March 2026
    * Fixed Date: 05:00 16 March 2026
    * Detection: manual test
    * Root Cause Type: Invalid CMake configuration
    * OS: Linux X11 (No OpenGL), Solaris 11
    * CPU: All

### Report

Font color is always wrong, the red component and the blue component is swapped.

### Analysis

In StratoHAL, we define the `HAL_USE_X11_SOFTRENDER` macro in
`CMakeLists.txt` to detect software rendering at
`platform.h`. However, that definition was defined by `PRIVATE`
scope. Therefore, Playfield Engine didn't define the same macro. As a
result, the return value of `hal_make_pixel()` was valid on StratoHAL
and invalid on Playfield Engine and Suika3.

### Patch

Fixed CMakeLists.txt of StratoHAL.

## Pencil tag is missing

* Report Details
    * ID: BUG-20260316-001

    * Fixed Date: 23:00 4 April 2026
    * Detection: document inspection
    * Root Cause Type: overlooked on porting
    * OS: All
    * CPU: All

### Report

A Suika2 command `@pencil` should be ported to `[pencil]` tag, but it's missing.

### Analysis

In the porting process from Suika2 to Suika3, that command was overlooked.

### Patch

Added the `[pencil]` tag and `Suika.drawTextOnLayer()` API.

Added/fixed:
- CMakeLists.txt
- src/api.c
- src/cmd_pencil.c

## Mouse click position is wrong on X11

* Report Details
    * ID: BUG-20260409-001
    * Status: Resolved
    * Component: StratoHAL
    * Severity: high
    * Priority: high

    * Detection: buzz testing
    * Root Cause Type: copy-and-taste misstake
    * OS: Linux, *BSD, Solaris
    * CPU: All

### Report

While mouse move position is good, mouse click position seems bad.

### Analysis

In `event_button_release()` in `x11main.c` and `x11softmain.c`,
mouse offset and scaling is bad.

### Patch

`event_button_release()` is fixed.

Fixed:
- external/PlayfieldEngine/external/StratoHAL/src/x11main.c
- external/PlayfieldEngine/external/StratoHAL/src/x11softmain.c

## Sequence of a save and loads will clear background

* Report Details
    * ID: BUG-20260419-001
    * Status: Resolved
    * Component: Suika3
    * Severity: high
    * Priority: high
    * Reproducibility: always
    * First Found In: dcc84e48e887931ad43413b53a29f1ae2a544092
    * Fixed In: 3fa47574eb076724a968b1f35481ecdf8756ada3
    * Reported Date: 15:00 18 April 2026
    * Fixed Date: 00:15 19 April 2026
    * Detection: found in a testing for NVL
    * Root Cause Type: Internal API misusage
    * OS: All
    * CPU: All
    * GitHub Issue: 

### Report

After performing a sequence of saving and loading
(specifically save -> load -> load),
the background image fails to load.

### Analysis

In `s3_set_layer_image()`, `destroy_layer()` is called
internally. This is a misuse of the internal API;
`destroy_layer()` also frees the filename of the layer.

Consequently, the following sequence in `save.c` corrupts the layer's
filename:

```
s3_set_layer_file_name()
s3_set_layer_image()
```

`s3_set_layer_image()` should call `s3_destroy_image()` instead of
destroy_layer().

### Patch

`s3_set_layer_image()` has been fixed.

Files modified:
- src/stage.c

## Load causes a crash in NVL mode

* Report Details
    * ID: BUG-20260419-002
    * Status: Resolved
    * Component: Suika3
    * Severity: high
    * Priority: high
    * Reproducibility: always
    * First Found In: 81ddb990151c3b20828598eb06df9aae5d1a04d3
    * Fixed In: 288e659b1e07a5374a21fdb0bc16ee4cdc229d97
    * Reported Date: 02:00 19 April 2026
    * Fixed Date: 04:20 19 April 2026
    * Detection: found in a testing for NVL
    * Root Cause Type: Lack of boundary condition
    * OS: All
    * CPU: All

### Report

Save in NVL mode, restart Suika3, then load.
This will cause a crash.

### Analysis

In `s3_append_history()`, `last_history_top` may be `-1` after a restart.
In this situation, `history[last_history_top]` may be an invalid access.

### Patch

`s3_append_history()` has been fixed.

Files modified:
- src/history.c
