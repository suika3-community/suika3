## Video playback is not working properly after a rendering.

### Report

Cannot play video files after a rendering.
Playing a video at the very first frame seems okay.

### Analysis

StratoHAL reused the main HWND of Direct3D 12 rendering to Media
Foundation EVR playback. However, once Direct3D swapchain is created
for the HWND, it cannot be shared with EVR.

### Patch

Added a rendering child HWND and a video child HWND.

### Report

If DirectShow is used for a video playback, the aspect ratio is wrong.

### Analysis

StratoHAL lacked the code for aspect ratio adjustment.

### Analysis

In StratoHAL, the video HWND didn't receive mouse events.

### Patch

Added event handlers for the video HWND in StratoHAL.

## Font color is wrong

* Report Details
    * ID: BUG-20260316-001
    * Status: Resolved
    * Component: StratoHAL / image / glyph
    * Severity: high
    * Priority: high
    * Reproducibility: always
    * First Found In: 6fda2bb1cf9155e0616043f5040f9793db3e8276
    * Fixed In: 82f0e0e86e3349269bf95a809b0a061eebc5cf40
    * Reported Date: 03:00 16 March 2026
    * Fixed Date: 05:00 16 March 2026
    * Detection: manual test
    * Root Cause Type: Invalid CMake configuration
    * OS: Linux X11 (No OpenGL), Solaris 11
    * CPU: All

### Report

Font color is always wrong, the red component and the blue component is swapped.

### Analysis

In StratoHAL, we define the `HAL_USE_X11_SOFTRENDER` macro in
`CMakeLists.txt` to detect software rendering at
`platform.h`. However, that definition was defined by `PRIVATE`
scope. Therefore, Playfield Engine didn't define the same macro. As a
result, the return value of `hal_make_pixel()` was valid on StratoHAL
and invalid on Playfield Engine and Suika3.

### Patch

Fixed CMakeLists.txt of StratoHAL.

    * Fixed Date: 23:00 4 April 2026
    * Detection: document inspection
    * Root Cause Type: overlooked on porting
    * OS: All
    * CPU: All

### Report

A Suika2 command `@pencil` should be ported to `[pencil]` tag, but it's missing.

### Analysis

In the porting process from Suika2 to Suika3, that command was overlooked.

### Patch

Added the `[pencil]` tag and `Suika.drawTextOnLayer()` API.

Added/fixed:
- CMakeLists.txt
- src/api.c
- src/cmd_pencil.c

### Report

While mouse move position is good, mouse click position seems bad.

### Analysis

In `event_button_release()` in `x11main.c` and `x11softmain.c`,
mouse offset and scaling is bad.

### Patch

`event_button_release()` is fixed.

Fixed:
- external/PlayfieldEngine/external/StratoHAL/src/x11main.c
- external/PlayfieldEngine/external/StratoHAL/src/x11softmain.c

## Sequence of a save and loads will clear background

* Report Details
    * ID: BUG-20260419-001
    * Status: Resolved
    * Component: Suika3
    * Severity: high
    * Priority: high
    * Reproducibility: always
    * First Found In: dcc84e48e887931ad43413b53a29f1ae2a544092
    * Fixed In: 3fa47574eb076724a968b1f35481ecdf8756ada3
    * Reported Date: 15:00 18 April 2026
    * Fixed Date: 00:15 19 April 2026
    * Detection: found in a testing for NVL
    * Root Cause Type: Internal API misusage
    * OS: All
    * CPU: All
    * GitHub Issue: 

### Report

After performing a sequence of saving and loading
(specifically save -> load -> load),
the background image fails to load.

### Analysis

In `s3_set_layer_image()`, `destroy_layer()` is called
internally. This is a misuse of the internal API;
`destroy_layer()` also frees the filename of the layer.

Consequently, the following sequence in `save.c` corrupts the layer's
filename:

```
s3_set_layer_file_name()
s3_set_layer_image()
```

`s3_set_layer_image()` should call `s3_destroy_image()` instead of
destroy_layer().

### Patch

`s3_set_layer_image()` has been fixed.

- src/stage.c

## Load causes a crash in NVL mode

* Report Details
    * ID: BUG-20260419-002
    * Status: Resolved
    * Component: Suika3
    * Severity: high
    * Priority: high
    * Reproducibility: always
    * First Found In: 81ddb990151c3b20828598eb06df9aae5d1a04d3
    * Fixed In: 288e659b1e07a5374a21fdb0bc16ee4cdc229d97
    * Reported Date: 02:00 19 April 2026
    * Fixed Date: 04:20 19 April 2026
    * Detection: found in a testing for NVL
    * Root Cause Type: Lack of boundary condition
    * OS: All
    * CPU: All

### Report

Save in NVL mode, restart Suika3, then load.
This will cause a crash.

### Analysis

In `s3_append_history()`, `last_history_top` may be `-1` after a restart.
In this situation, `history[last_history_top]` may be an invalid access.

### Patch

`s3_append_history()` has been fixed.

    * Fixed Date: 06:15 20 April 2026
    * Detection: found in a multiplatform testing (GitHub #7)
    * Root Cause Type: mkdir() call missing
    * OS: All
    * CPU: All

### Report

On the Wasm version, save will cause an error.

### Analysis

In `emmain.c`, `hal_make_save_directory()` is not implemented.
In addition, that function is not called.

### Patch

`hal_make_save_directory()` has been fixed.

    * Root Cause Type: wrong implementation of hal_open_rfile()
    * OS: iOS, Wasm
    * CPU: All

### Report

On the Wasm version, save --> load will cause a bad behavior.

### Analysis

In `hal_open_rfile()` in `stdfile.c`,
the treatment of save files was wrong.

### Patch

`hal_open_rfile()` has been fixed.

- external/PlayfieldEngine/external/StratoHAL/src/stdfile.c

## Cannot clear the background by file="none"

* Report Details
    * ID: BUG-20260426-001
    * Status: Resolved
    * Component: Suika3
    * Severity: high
    * Priority: high

    * Detection: developer testing (@lalalll-lalalll GitHub #21)
    * Root Cause Type: missing implementation
    * OS: iOS, Wasm
    * CPU: All

### Report

When attempting to clear the current background using the following command, the engine throws an error.
```
[bg file="none"]
```

### Analysis

Analysis:
- The logic to detect a special file name "none" was missing.
- So the engine tried to open "none" as an image file.
- But "none" doesn't have an extension such as ".png"
- Therefore the engine did output an errror "Cannot determine the file type for "%s".

### Patch

`s3i_tag_bg()` was patched.

Files modified:
- src/cmd_bg.c

## Thumbnail image pixel shift in save data preview

* Report Details
    * ID: BUG-20260426-002

    * Fixed Date: 05:15 27 April 2026
    * Detection: developer testing (@lalalll-lalalll GitHub #25)
    * Root Cause Type: Lack of horizontal rollout of corrections
    * OS: All
    * CPU: All

### Report

There is a visible rendering artifact in the save
thumbnails. Specifically, the rightmost vertical column of pixels is
incorrectly shifted and appears on the far left side of the image.

### Analysis

Analysis:
- In `load_basic_save_info()`, before reading the thumbnail, reading `u32: page line` was missing.
- Therefore, image pixels were 4 bytes shifted left.

### Patch

`load_basic_save_info()` was patched.

Files modified:
- src/save.c

## Full-screen/windowed switching causes crash when using Direct3D 12

* Report Details
    * ID: BUG-20260427-001
    * Status: Resolved
    * Component: StratoHAL
    * Severity: high
    * Priority: high
    * Reproducibility: frequently
    * First Found In: 88649ac3a04b1982f8867ac89184a3c6e196414b
    * Fixed In: 21d546781a4bfe284920649c9a4a904c998abf5a
    * Reported Date: 09:00 27 April 2026
    * Fixed Date: 09:45 27 April 2026
    * Detection: Author's exploratory testing
    * Root Cause Type: Mistakes on STL usage and resource reinitialization
    * OS: Windows 10/11
    * CPU: x86/x86_64/arm64

### Report

Switching from full screen mode to windowed mode may cause crash.

### Analysis

Analysis:
- Cause 1: Mistake on STL usage
    - In `D3D12EndFrame()`, `std::find()` may not find a valid entry.
    - Passing the result of `std::find()` directly to `erase()` caused assertion error inside STL.
- Cause 2: Mistake on D3D12 reinitialization
    - When switching between full-screen mode and windowed mode, D3D12 will be reinitialized.
    - In `ReleaseAllD3D12Objects()`, `g_freeTextureBundleList` was not cleared on D3D12 reinitialization.
    - In `UploadTextureIfNeeded()`, `img->texture` was not NULLified when D3D12 was reinitialized.
    - This made inconsistency of texture management, and caused crashes.

### Patch

`d3d12render.cc` was patched.

- external/PlayfieldEngine/external/StratoHAL/src/d3d12render.cc
