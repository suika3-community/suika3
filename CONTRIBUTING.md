Contributing to Suika3
======================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Suika3**.  
Suika3 is more than a software project — it is a community built around
stories, creativity, and accessibility.

We welcome contributors of all backgrounds, skill levels, and regions.
Whether you write code, documentation, tools, tests, or ideas, you are
part of this ecosystem.

## Our Values

Before contributing, please take a moment to understand the principles
that guide this project:

* **Stories are for everyone.**  
  Creation is a fundamental human activity, not a privilege.

* **Accessibility matters.**  
  Suika3 is designed to run on low-cost hardware and diverse platforms.
  Contributions should respect this goal.

* **Sustainability over hype.**  
  We value long-term maintainability, clarity, and stability over
  short-lived trends.

* **Respect and trust.**  
  We collaborate across cultures, languages, and experiences.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch for your change.
3. Make your changes with clear, readable commits.
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) against the main branch.

Please describe **what you changed** and **why**.
If your change is user-facing or architectural, include context and
design rationale.

## Coding Guidelines

* Keep the code **simple, readable, and maintainable**.
* Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
* Be mindful of performance on low-spec hardware.
* Prefer portable, native solutions over platform-specific shortcuts.
* Follow existing code style and conventions where possible.

If you are unsure about a design decision, open an issue or discussion
before implementing it.

## Discussions and Proposals

Large changes, new features, or architectural refactors should start
with an issue or discussion.

We encourage:
* Clear problem statements
* Trade-off analysis
* Consideration for backward compatibility
* Awareness of long-term maintenance costs

Consensus matters more than speed.
