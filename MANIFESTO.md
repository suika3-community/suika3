Manifesto
=========

## Stories Belong to Everyone.

We believe that storytelling is one of humanity's most powerful forms
of recording information. Creating and sharing stories should not be a
privilege reserved for the few — it is a fundamental human right.

## Accessibility Without Borders.

Creative tools should be open and accessible to all, regardless of
wealth, geography, or hardware. Suika3 is intentionally engineered to
run smoothly on entry-level, affordable PCs. Your creativity should
never be limited by the price tag of your hardware.

## Empowering Creators Worldwide.

We envision a world where you can develop for platforms you've never
even touched, reaching audiences far beyond your immediate
environment. By empowering creators, we aim to foster an open
ecosystem where:

* **Players** are emotionally enriched by a diverse tapestry of stories.
* **Developers** can sustain themselves both creatively and economically.

This is more than just software. This is an invitation to create.
