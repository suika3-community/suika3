## Why Playfield Engine?

_"If a game engine could run anywhere, how would the world change?"_

Playfield Engine was born from this single question.

Creativity shouldn't depend on the power of your computer, where you
live, or what tools you have.  Playfield Engine was created with the
belief that every creator deserves space to explore, no matter their
surroundings.

It runs smoothly even on older or low-spec machines — if you have a
computer, there's a place for you to create.  It's a helpful companion
for creators everywhere — especially in places with fewer resources.
If you have something to make, Playfield Engine will be here to walk
with you.

Whether you're using a Raspberry Pi in a classroom, or using a
UN-issued Chromebook in a temporary shelter, Playfield Engine offers
gentle tools to help bring your ideas to life — in a way that feels
simple, thoughtful, and your own.

The goal is simple:
**To make game development accessible, thoughtful, and within reach
for everyone.**

**Dreams fuel it — and they're the only requirement.**

## Example

Here's a simple example that displays an image following the mouse
cursor. This shows the basic lifecycle:
`setup` (window config),
`start` (asset loading),
`update` (per-frame logic and texture loading), and
`render` (per-frame rendering).

```
// Called when the window is created.
func setup() {
    // Return the window configuration.
    return {
        width: 1280,
        height: 720,
        title: "My First Game"
    };
}

// Called once when the game starts.
func start() {
    // Create a white 100x100 texture.
    tex = Engine.createColorTexture({
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
        r: 255, g: 255, b: 255, a: 255
    });
}

// Called every frame before rendering.
func update() {
    posX = Engine.mousePosX;
    posY = Engine.mousePosY;
}

// Called every frame to render graphics.
func render() {
    Engine.draw({ texture: tex, x: posX, y: posY });
}
```

## Technical Overview

Playfield Engine is not merely a wrapper around SDL combined with a
scripting language. It features its own rendering and audio backends,
and its own scripting language, positioning it as a fully independent
game engine.

### Core Architecture

```
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|                       User Scripts                       |
+----------------------------------------------------------+

+--------------------------------+  +----------------------+
|  StratoHAL (Rendering/Audio)   |  |   NoctLang VM (JIT)  |
+--------------------------------+  +----------------------|
```

* **Scripting**:
  Integrates [NoctLang](https://github.com/awemorris/NoctLang), a
  tiny yet mighty language designed for game scripting.

* **Rendering**:
  Supports native DirectX 9/11/12, Metal, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, and WebGL for wide compatibility.

* **Audio**:
  Provides lightweight audio support through native DirectSound (Windows), Audio Unit (macOS/iOS),
  ALSA (Linux), OSS (BSD), and other APIs.

### StratoHAL

StratoHAL originated as the codebase of a 2D game engine developed
since 2001, and has been open-sourced with a proven record of
exceptional stability. Evolving over a quarter century from the
Windows 9x era, StratoHAL has grown to support macOS, Linux, iOS,
Android, WebAssembly, and Unity. It has been running reliably on
smartphones for more than a decade. While SDL3 already exists as a
popular open-source alternative, StratoHAL covers the same major
platforms as SDL3 — and uniquely provides console support through
Unity without relying on any NDA-restricted code.

### Platform Support

|Platform Type  |OS / Platform       |Notes                                     |

|Console        |Unity               |Unity Plugin                              |

### Console Unity Plugin Notice

Playfield Engine provides Unity Plugin binaries for platforms
including Windows 64-bit and game consoles.  These binaries are built
entirely with the open-source version of LLVM/Clang toolchain (no
proprietary SDKs).

### NoctLang

```
Playfield Script = NoctLang + Playfield API
```

**NoctLang** is a lightweight scripting language designed specifically
for Playfield Engine. With a game-oriented syntax, it emphasizes
clarity, instant startup, and tight integration with the engine.

The built-in JIT compiler supports a wide range of CPU architectures,
including both 32-bit and 64-bit of: **Intel, Arm, RISC-V, PowerPC, MIPS.**

For platforms where JIT is restricted (such as mobile or consoles),
NoctLang can fall back to interpreter mode, and AOT (ahead-of-time)
compilation using a C source backend — ensuring full compatibility
even in tightly controlled environments.

### Script Execution Mode

|Platform       |Mode               |
|---------------|-------------------|
|Windows x86    |JIT                |
|Windows x64    |JIT                |
|Windows arm64  |JIT                |
|macOS x86_64   |JIT                |
|macOS arm64    |JIT                |
|Linux x86      |JIT                |
|Linux x86_64   |JIT                |
|Linux armv7    |JIT                |
|Linux arm64    |JIT                |
|FreeBSD x86_64 |JIT                |
|iOS            |Interpreter or AOT |
|Android        |Interpreter or AOT |
|WebAssembly    |Interpreter or AOT |
|Unity Plugin   |Interpreter or AOT |

### Runtime Footprint

|Platform       |Binary Size    |Memory Usage (GC)                                              |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|All targets    |~2 MB          |Allocates 256 MB at startup for GC; does not exceed that limit |

The garbage collector allocates 256 MB at startup because currently 256 MB is the maximum heap size.

### Garbage Collection

Playfield Engine implements a high-performance garbage collector
similar to the HotSpot VM in Java, so you generally don’t need to
worry much about delays caused by garbage collection.

* The garbage collector uses a generational GC, managing objects in young and old generations.
* Young-generation GC runs extremely fast using a copying algorithm (semi-space copy GC).
* Old-generation GC uses a mark-and-sweep algorithm and performs compaction when necessary (mark-sweep-compact GC).

## NoctVM Ecosystem

Playfield Engine is a part of the [NoctVM](https://noctvm.io/) ecosystem:

- **NoctLang** — portable scripting language (used in this project)
- **Playfield Engine* — go-anywhere 2D game engine (this project)
- NoctUI — a declarative UI library (not used in this project)

Together, they form the foundation of the Noct ecosystem.
NoctLang itself is just the core language engine with no complex runtime.
Playfield Engine is one of the runtimes that embeds and extends the NoctLang core.
