## Introduction

Suika3 is a production-grade visual novel engine specifically
engineered for commercial mobile app development, developed by Awe
Morris with the Suika3 Community.

Games made with Suika3 are powered by `NovelML 3.0` and `SuikaScript 3.0`.

- **NovelML 3.0**: A tag-based, human-readable, extensible DSL
  designed specifically for visual novels. It features concise,
  declarative tags for seamless dialogue and scene control. Developers
  can add custom tags by SuikaScript.

- **SuikaScript 3.0**: The robust extension language for Suika3. It
  utilizes a high-speed JIT compiler on desktop platforms and can be
  compiled into native binaries for production or mobile
  environments.

Although Suika3 is designed as a professional tool, you are absolutely
welcome to use it just for fun — after all, fun is the driving force
behind every great community.

---

## Key Features

With lead developer's 10+ years of R&D experience in computer science,
Suika3 is engineered with modern techniques, and delivers:

- **High Performance**: Powered by the Suika JIT VM, it delivers
  2.5-4.5x faster execution speed compared to our interpreter backend
  in synthetic benchmarks.

- **Lightweight**: Engineered to run smoothly at 60 fps even on
  low-spec hardware such as Raspberry Pi in developing regions.

- **True Portability**: Designed with a "port anywhere" strategy,
  ensuring compatibility with almost every modern platform.

- **Extensible**: NovelML can be seamlessly extended using
  SuikaScript. Developers can implement custom tags simply by writing
  a SuikaScript function named `Tag_*()`.

- **Reliable**: We do certain `Quality Assurance Process` to deliver
  reliable software.

- **Mobile UI/UX:** The default UX is mobile-first with a hamburger
  menu. Desktop-style tiny buttons on message windows are not a
  primary target due to mobile usability and store review risks.

- **Battery-Friendly:** Idle CPU and GPU usages are around 1%, making
  it perfect for long-play on mobile devices.

- **Long-Term Support:** Our codebase is so portable and designed to
  support future platforms through the 2030s, 2040s, and beyond.

## Getting Started Guide

This guide will help you jump-start your very first visual novel
project in just a few easy steps.

### 1. Your First Run

Let's get the engine running so you can see the magic happen!

- **Download:** Grab the latest release ZIP file from the official source.
- **Extract:** Right-click the ZIP file and select "Extract All" to a folder of your choice.
- **Launch:** Open the folder and run `suika3.exe`. A sample game will start immediately!

### 2. Personalize Your Story (`start.novel`)

Now, let's make the game say exactly what you want.

- **Open:** Find the `start.novel` file in your project folder and
open it with your favorite text editor. It is written in
`NovelML`.
- **Edit:** Replace the existing text with the following command:
```
[text text="Hello, world! This is my first game."]
```
- **Test:** Save the file and run `suika3.exe` again. You should see your new message on the screen!

### 3. Customize the Screen (`main.pf`)

You can easily change the look and feel of your game window.

- **Locate:** Open the `main.pf` file in your editor.
- **Modify:** Look for the `func setup()` section. You can change the resolution and the title of your window here:
```
// Called when the window is opened.
func setup() {
    return {
        width:      1280,            // The width of your game
        height:     720,             // The height of your game
        title:      "My First Game", // Your game's title
        fullscreen: false            // Set to true for full-screen mode
    };
}
```

### 4. Under the Hood (Advanced Tips)

The bottom part of your `main.pf` file contains the core engine logic
in `SuikaScript`. It's best to leave these functions as they are
unless you are doing advanced customization:

- `func start()`: This is called once when your game launches.
- `func update()`: This runs every single frame to handle game logic.
- `func render()`: This draws everything on the screen after the update is done.

```
// Called before the game starts.
func start() {
    // Load plugins here.
    // Suika.loadPlugin("testplugin");

    // Do not delete the following line.
    Suika.start();
}

// Called before a frame rendering.
func update() {
    // Do not delete the following line.
    Suika.update();
}

// Called every frame rendering.
func render() {
    // Do not delete the following line.
    Suika.render();
}
```

> [!TIP]
> These functions are the core mechanism of the `Playfield Engine` that
> powers Suika3. Suika.start(), Suika.update(), and Suika.render() must
> remain in place for the game to function properly.

---

## Quick Look

### NovelML

`start.novel` file looks like:

```
# Show a background image.
[bg file="bg/coast.png" time="0.5"]

# Show a character image.
[ch center="ch/midori-normal.png" time="0.5" fade="normal"]

# Show a question text.
[text text="Choose a name."]

# Show options.
[choose
    name="choose_result"
    text1="March"
    text2="April"
    text3="May"
]

# Branch by the choose's result.
[if lhs="${choose_result}" op="==" rhs="March"]
    [set name="name" value="March"]
[elseif lhs="${choose_result}" op="==" rhs="April"]
    [set name="name" value="April"]
[else]
    [set name="name" value="May"]
[endif]

# Show a text.
[text name="${name}" text="Hello! My name is ${name}."]
```

## Build Locally

Refer to [build.md](docs/mkdocs-en/docs/build.md) for platform-specific instructions.

---

## Examples

A sample game is planned to be built in the end of March 2026.

See the `game/` directory for:
- Minimal demo project
- Sample assets and NovelML snippets
- SuikaScript usage patterns

---

### Why SuikaScript?

- **Instant Iteration:** No compile cycles, no waiting. The built-in
  JIT compiler runs your scripts immediately after editing, so you can
  tweak gameplay and see results in real-time.

- **True Native Performance:** Run extensions at full speed on iOS,
  Android, and consoles. Even on platforms where JIT is restricted,
  you never have to sacrifice performance thanks to AOT.

- **Sandbox Model:** Scripts cannot access arbitrary
files/network. Only game assets and save data are accessible via
engine-managed APIs.

- **Smooth Store Approval:** Dramatically lower the risk of
  rejection. Since final builds consist of native code via AOT, you'll
  breeze through App Store and console certifications.

- **Easy to Learn, Powerful to Use:** The JavaScript-inspired syntax
  is friendly for beginners, yet offers the deep flexibility
  experienced developers expect for complex systems.

- **Long-term Stability:** Because we develop the language in-house,
  you're shielded from breaking changes in upstream projects. We own
  and control the full stack, so your scripts stay compatible forever.

## Technical Overview

If these specifications excite you, you're probably in the right
place.

Suika3 is not merely a wrapper around SDL combined with a scripting
language. It features its own rendering and audio backends, and its
own scripting language, positioning it as a fully independent game
engine.

### Core Architecture

Suika3 is based on `PlayField Engine`, a comprehensive 2D game engine.
This means that Suika3 is fully extensible using the Playfield API.

(Playfield Engine was originally developed specifically for Suika3.
The name "Playfield" was inspired by PlayStation during Awe's time at
the SIE PlayStation firmware team.)

```

- **Scripting**: Integrates
  [NoctLang](https://github.com/awemorris/NoctLang), a tiny yet mighty
  language designed for game scripting.

* **Rendering**: Supports native DirectX 9/11/12, Metal, OpenGL,
  OpenGL ES, and WebGL for wide compatibility.

* **Audio**: Provides lightweight audio support through native
  DirectSound or XAudio2 (Windows), Audio Unit (macOS/iOS), ALSA
  (Linux), OSS (BSD), and other APIs.

### StratoHAL

StratoHAL originated as the codebase of a 2D game engine developed
since 2001, and has been Zlib-licensed with a proven record of
exceptional stability.

Evolving over a quarter century from the Windows 9x era, StratoHAL has
grown to support macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, WebAssembly, and Unity.
It has been running reliably on smartphones for more than a decade.

While SDL3 already exists as a popular free/libre software
alternative, StratoHAL covers:

- The same major platforms as SDL3.

- Uniquely provides console support through Unity Integration without
  relying on any NDA-restricted code.

- Software 3D rendering for older platforms.

### Console Unity Plugin Notice

Playfield Engine provides Unity Plugin binaries for platforms
including Windows 64-bit and game consoles.  These binaries are built
entirely with the official version of LLVM/Clang toolchain (no
proprietary SDKs).

For Xbox series, you can use the native Microsoft GDK port directly, not via Unity.

### NoctLang

```
SuikaScript = NoctLang + Suika3 API
```

**NoctLang** is a lightweight scripting language designed for in-app
scripting.  With a game-oriented syntax, it emphasizes clarity,
instant startup, and tight integration with the engine.

The built-in JIT compiler supports a wide range of CPU architectures
to cover most gaming consoles and smartphones, including:

- ✅ Intel x86 (Xbox) [jit-x86.c](https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3/blob/main/external/PlayfieldEngine/external/NoctLang/src/core/jit-x86.c)
- ✅ AMD64/x86_64 (PS4/PS5/Xbox One/Xbox series X|S) [jit-x86_64.c](https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3/blob/main/external/PlayfieldEngine/external/NoctLang/src/core/jit-x86_64.c)
- ✅ ARMv5-ARMv7 (Nintendo DS/PS Vita) [jit-arm32.c](https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3/blob/main/external/PlayfieldEngine/external/NoctLang/src/core/jit-arm32.c)
- ✅ Arm64 (Switch/Switch2) [jit-arm64.c](https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3/blob/main/external/PlayfieldEngine/external/NoctLang/src/core/jit-arm64.c)
- ✅ PowerPC 32 (Wii/GameCube) [jit-ppc32.c](https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3/blob/main/external/PlayfieldEngine/external/NoctLang/src/core/jit-ppc32.c)
- ✅ PowerPC 64 (PS3/Xbox 360) [jit-ppc64.c](https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3/blob/main/external/PlayfieldEngine/external/NoctLang/src/core/jit-ppc64.c)
- ✅ MIPS32 (PS1/PSP) [jit-mips32.c](https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3/blob/main/external/PlayfieldEngine/external/NoctLang/src/core/jit-mips32.c)
- ✅ MIPS64 (N64/PS2) [jit-mips64.c](https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3/blob/main/external/PlayfieldEngine/external/NoctLang/src/core/jit-mips64.c)
- ✅ RISC-V 32 (for future devices) [jit-riscv32.c](https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3/blob/main/external/PlayfieldEngine/external/NoctLang/src/core/jit-riscv32.c)
- ✅ RISC-V 64 (for future devices) [jit-riscv64.c](https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3/blob/main/external/PlayfieldEngine/external/NoctLang/src/core/jit-riscv64.c)

These architectures are well-supported, we can say at least they all pass [the test suite](external/PlayfieldEngine/external/NoctLang/tests/run-syntax.sh).

However, the following are not supported yet because of the lack of development machines:

- ❌ SH-4 (Dreamcast)
- ❌ Sun SPARC
- ❌ HP PA-RISC
- ❌ Motorola 68000
- ❌ Loongson
- ❌ IBM Z
- **Challenge:** If you have one, please provide a ssh access to the development environment for 3 days. We can port there.

### AOT Compilation

For platforms where JIT is restricted (such as mobile or consoles),
NoctLang can fall back to interpreter mode, and AOT (ahead-of-time)
compilation using a C source backend — ensuring full compatibility
even in tightly controlled environments.

Please see [AOT](docs/mkdocs-en/docs/aot.md) for more details.

### Script Execution Mode

|Platform          |Mode               |
|------------------|-------------------|
|Windows x86       |JIT                |
|Windows x64       |JIT                |

### Runtime Footprint

The footprint of Suika3 is very small.

| OS           | Binary Size  | Memory Usage                |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Windows 11   | 2 MB         | 300 MB in the task manager  |
| Windows 2000 | 3 MB         | 8 MB in the task manager    |

> [!TIP]
> Due to the modern graphics architecture, game applications using
> DirectX 12 typically consume at least 300 MB of memory even before
> loading any game assets. The engine itself consumes only 8 MB on
> Windows 2000.

### JIT Pipeline

SuikaScript uses a dual-IR architecture where HIR handles analysis and
LIR unifies execution across interpreter, JIT, and AOT backends:

- **HIR (High-level Intermediate Representation)**
    - Structured control flow graph (CFG) for program analysis.
    - Expression DAG for algebraic simplification.
    - Basis for future advanced optimizations.

```
CFG for "func foo(a) { if (a > 0) { return a; } else { return -a; } }"

  +---------------+
  | 0: Func Block |         -- pred: none, succ: 1
  +---------------+
     +-------------+
     | 1: IF Block |        -- pred: 0, succ: 2 (true), 3 (false)
     +-------------+
        +----------------+

- **LIR (Low-level Intermediate Representation)**
    - VM bytecode, serving as the primary format for both interpretation and JIT codegen input.
    - High abstraction level to achieve fast, portable interpretation.
    - Compact enough for efficient machine code lowering in the JIT.

```
  LIR for "a = 1 + 2"

    ICONST       %0, 1               ; Load constant 1
    ICONST       %1, 2               ; Load constant 2
    ADD          %2, %0, %1          ; Compute sum
    STORESYMBOL  "a", %2             ; Store result into global variable "a"
```

Compilation stages are as below.

```
 +-----+     +-----+     +-----+     +-----+
 | SRC | --> | AST | --> | HIR | --> | LIR | -----> [Interpreter Backend]
 +-----+     +-----+     +-----+     +-----+   |
                                               +--> [JIT Backend]
                                               |
                                               +--> [C Backend]
```

The separation of HIR and LIR enables:

- **A lightweight JIT pipeline**: minimal overhead from analysis to code generation.
- **Clarity in architecture**: each stage has a well-defined role, simplifying maintenance.
- **Portability**: the same LIR can be interpreted directly or lowered into optimized machine code.

As shown above, HIR expresses structure, while LIR expresses execution.
This split allows SuikaScript to keep the JIT pipeline lightweight without sacrificing optimization opportunities.

Because all JIT backends translate from the same LIR, portability across architectures comes naturally.
This unified approach is what makes SuikaScript both portable and maintainable.

## Garbage Collection

Suika3 features a high-performance generational garbage collector,
inspired by the architecture of the Java HotSpot VM. This design
ensures that developers can focus on creation without being
interrupted by the dreaded "GC spikes" or frame drops.

Objects in scripts (strings, dictionaries) are managed by GC,
while large assets such as textures are managed by native code.

### Core Mechanism: Generational GC

The system categorizes objects into two groups to optimize memory
management:

* Young Generation: Most objects die young. Suika3 handles these using
  a high-speed Copying Algorithm (Semi-space Copy GC), which clears
  out temporary data in a flash. (typically < 0.1ms)

* Old Generation: Long-lived objects are moved here. This area uses a
  Mark-Sweep-Compact GC algorithm, which periodically reorganizes
  memory to prevent fragmentation. (typically 10-300ms)

For more detailed implementation, please check
[gc.h](external/PlayfieldEngine/external/NoctLang/src/core/gc.h) and
[gc.c](external/PlayfieldEngine/external/NoctLang/src/core/gc.c).

### Frame-Synchronized Latency Hiding

The real "magic" of Suika3 lies in its timing. By executing the
Young-generation Copy GC every single frame, the system effectively
hides the GC processing time within the natural frame interval.

Thanks to this generational strategy, the heavier Old-generation
Mark-and-Sweep is rarely triggered, maintaining a constant 60 fps
experience for the player.

### How to switch languages

Playfield Engine uses the system locale.  To switch languages, set
your system locale.

### Contributing Translations

We welcome community contributions to improve our translations!
If you want to help us reach more developers, here is how you can contribute:

0.  Do `grep -r _TR() .` and detect original messages.
1.  **Locate the Files**: Translation assets are managed across three core directories:
    - `resources/i18n/message.txt` (Suika3 part, `S3_TR()`)
    - `external/PlayfieldEngine/resources/i18n/message.txt` (Playfield Engine part, `PF_TR()`)
    - `external/PlayfieldEngine/external/NoctLang/i18n/message.txt` (NoctLang part, `N_TR()`)
    - `external/PlayfieldEngine/external/StratoHAL/i18n/message.txt` (StratoHAL part, `HAL_TR()`)
2.  **Submit Your Changes**: 
    - Found a typo or a weird machine translation? Feel free to open a **Pull Request**.
    - Want to add a new language? Please open an **Issue** first so we can coordinate!

> [!TIP]
> Manual/Professional translations are prioritized over
> machine-generated content. Your human touch makes a huge difference!

## Codebase & Maturity

Suika3 is a robust visual novel engine with over 100k lines of code (LoC).
This is not a weekend project but a mature codebase evolved over 25+ years.

- **Proven Stability:** Includes core modules refined since 2001.

- **Modern Architecture:** Features a clean HAL (Hardware Abstraction
 Layer) separated in 2016 and high-performance GPU rendering
 implemented in 2022.

- **Native Multi-Platform:** Built mostly with C, and the platform
 native languages, including C++ (DirectX), Swift (macOS/iOS),
 Objective-C (macOS/iOS), C# (Unity) and Shaders (HLSL/GLSL/Metal).

---

## Quality Assurance

In `Software Engineering`, reliability is a function of time. As
Suika3 is currently in its pre-release phase, we define its cumulative
operational time as zero. Consequently, formal quality metrics are not
yet applicable.

### Our Path to Stability

We are committed to delivering a production-grade engine. Our QA
roadmap is as follows:

1. **Release Candidate (RC) Phase**: Upon reaching the RC milestone,
  we will initiate rigorous tracking of all identified issues.
  See [BUGS.md](BUGS.md)

2. **Data-Driven Hardening**: We will analyze bug discovery and
  resolution rates to quantify the software's stability.

3. **Commercial-Grade Standards**: Our final goal is to achieve a
  level of robustness that meets the requirements of commercial visual
  novel productions.

While the engine is still "young" in terms of uptime, the underlying
architecture inherits over two decades of development philosophy,
ensuring a solid foundation for the upcoming QA process.

## Adoption Status

We aim to create a new market for "Mobile Visual Novels" and have not
yet established a track record.

If you are interested in helping shape this new market as an **Early
Adopter**, we warmly invite you to join our community.

If you prefer to adopt tools with an established track record, you may
wish to revisit the project once Suika3 has matured further.

## Game Packaging & Distribution

To generate `assets.arc` from your game assets, please use the
`suika3-pack` tool provided in this repository. This tool will create
an obfuscated archive of your assets that can be efficiently loaded by
the engine. (The obfuscation algorithm is a key rotating XOR, and it
is not intended for strong security. It can help prevent casual
tampering. The obfuscation key can be changed in "key.h".)

| OS                 | Assets                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows            | Assets should be stored into a file name `assets.arc`.                                                                         |
| macOS              | Assets should be stored into `Contents/Resources/assets.arc` inside the app bundle.                                            |
| Linux              | Assets should be stored into a file name `assets.arc`.                                                                         |
| iOS                | Assets should be stored into `Contents/Resources/assets.arc` inside the app bundle.                                            |
| Android            | Assets must not be packed. Please add your assets to the `app/src/main/assets/` folder directly as normal files.               |
| HarmonyOS NEXT     | Assets must not be packed. Please add your assets to the `entry/src/main/resources/rawfiles/` folder directly as normal files. |
| WebAssembly (Wasm) | Assets should be stored into `assets.arc` and placed alongside `index.html`.                                                   |

## Lineage: The Grand Journey

Suika3 represents the culmination of over two decades of relentless innovation and development:

- **Suika Studio (2001–2004)**: The origin of our codebase, featuring
  our first GUI-based editors.

- **Unfruitiful (2005–2015)**: A decade of R&D focused on establishing
  a robust portability layer for cross-platform support.

- **Suika2 (2016–2024)**: The cornerstone of our current architecture
  and the fruit of a decade of dedicated R&D. It delivers a full
  visual novel experience with extensive platform compatibility.
  Several games with Suika3 were sold on App Store.

- **Playfield Engine (2025–)**: A versatile 2D engine derived from the
  core portability layer of the Suika series.

- **Suika3 (2026–)**: By synthesizing these legacies and introducing
  `NovelML` and `SuikaScript`, Suika3 delivers the stability of its
  predecessors alongside the flexibility of modern technology.

## Why Suika3?: Our Philosophy

We are not looking at the existing VN market. We aim to pioneer a
mobile VN market that does not yet exist.

Creators with different goals may also find excellent resources in
other engines like Ren'Py, Unity, or Godot.

### Mission: Building a Sustainable Ecosystem

Our dedication to the commercial success of visual novels is a
strategic response to the long-term health of the medium. We believe
that for visual novels to flourish in the 2030s, they must transcend
hobbyist boundaries and re-establish themselves as a thriving creative
industry.

Since the 2010s, the visual novel market has faced significant growth
challenges. One critical bottleneck has been the **lack of
high-performance software engines** capable of delivering a seamless
**native experience on iOS and Android**. While developers typically
work on PCs, for most people today, the primary personal computer is a
smartphone.

Without accessible, professional-grade tools for modern mobile
platforms, many creators have been restricted to limited distribution
channels. As a result, the medium has struggled to reach a global,
mobile-first audience, slowing its overall expansion.

While free and hobbyist projects are culturally valuable and
indispensable, they alone may not always sustain a large creative
industry. A truly healthy ecosystem may require:

- **Commercially Viable Games** — Titles that reach players on their
  primary devices and generate the economic activity necessary for
  creators to build long-term careers.

- **Economic Independence** — Empowering talent, particularly in Asia
  and the Global South, to overcome economic barriers through
  storytelling.

- **A Living Industry** — Transforming the medium from a niche
  interest into a sustainable market where creativity can lead to
  self-reliance.

In our view, it is a natural professional expectation for commercial
success.

Please note that this philosophy does not reject hobbyist or
experimental projects. We simply focus on a different problem space:
sustainability at scale.

### Our Vision: Catalyst for Growth

We do not aim to provide just another tool. Our goal is to provide a
**catalyst for growth**.

By offering a "port-anywhere" engine that delivers native performance
without the overhead of heavy frameworks, we enable developers to
focus on what matters most: **telling stories that endure.**

Because we love visual novels, we are committed to pushing the medium
forward and ensuring it remains a vibrant and economically viable art
form for decades to come.

### Our Values: Empowering Talents for Sustainable Careers

Our value is to empower talent—particularly in Asia and the Global
South—to build sustainable careers through their storytelling. We
believe that with the right tools, creativity can overcome economic
barriers.

Our commitment to the permissive license is for those people who
publish and sell original visual novels on the App Store and Google
Play, regardless of their software, hardware, and budget limitations.

### What's this?

Suika3 is a next-generation visual novel engine designed with
professional studios and commercial app development in mind. It aims
for high performance, long-term maintainability, and broad platform
support through native implementations (primarily in C).

### Is this a competitor to existing engines such as Ren'Py, Unity, or Godot?

Rather than being competitors, we target different problem
areas. Suika3 clearly states its direction as "creating a
mobile-centric VN market that can withstand commercial use," and
respects existing engines as viable options.

### Is this okay to use for now?

Since actual operational uptime is zero, quality metrics are still
pending, it states honestly. Users can choose whether to "participate
as an Early Adopter" or "wait several years" before making an
adoption decision.

### Doesn't "over 25 years of maturity" contradict "zero operational use"?

Suika3 itself is a new integration, but it builds upon a long lineage
including Suika2 and StratoHAL. In other words, it's a "new package
with an old foundation."

### Oh it's bus factor 1, isn't it?

The policy explicitly states "encouraging forks and rebrands" and
"maintaining a clean upstream without formal governance," fostering an
approach that makes downstream maintenance easier.

### Can companies maintain their own forks?

With both "Software Requirement Specification" (SRS) and "Software
Design Specification" (SDS) provided, it is ideal for enterprise
maintenance. Furthermore, "professional/enterprise support" is
available, enabling the transfer of necessary know-how to the adopting
organization.

### It says community-led, but who makes the decisions?

The community handles maintenance, while lead members take the
lead. We do not implement formal governance.

### Is Suika3 open source software? Can it be used commercially?

Yes, it is OSS and can be used commercially. Since it is a permissive
license, there is no requirement to disclose the source code when
modifying it.

### What about the license for third-party libraries?

See [NOTICE](NOTICE) for the full text of each license and copyright
notice for the third-party libraries used in Suika3.

### JIT is disabled on iOS/console, so what should I do?

The official binaries use an interpreter in those environments. While
we believe our interpreter is sufficiently fast, if you require speed
or if even the interpreter poses a problem for a store review, please
use [AOT](docs/mkdocs-en/aot.md). This is a perfect solution boasting
2.5-4.5x the speed compared to the interpreter.

### Are scripts safe? Can they access files or the network?

No, scripts run in a sandboxed environment and cannot access files
outside the resource bundle or the network. It can access only the
APIs exposed by the engine, which are designed to be safe for game
logic.

### Is it easy to pass the store review?

We believe that using AOT compilation dramatically lowers the hurdle
for store reviews, as it essentially becomes a native app simply
executing tags, not running a generic-purpose scripting. However, we
cannot guarantee the outcome of store reviews, as they can be up to
the game quality including graphical design, user experience, and
content.

### Is "Supports all modern platforms" really true?

It's understandable that you find this hard to believe, but everything
is working according to our checks. However, when you ship it as a
product, please perform QA/QC at your own responsibility.

### What does "via Unity" mean for console support?

Even if we port Suika3 to consoles, we cannot disclose its source code
due to the NDA. However, dedicated versions of Unity are available for
consoles. Therefore, we ported Suika3 into a Unity plugin. Using this
plugin allows you to run Suika3 within Unity. In other words, if you
have the console version of Unity and a "devkit" machine, you can run
Suika3 on consoles as well.

Please understand that the console has UI/UX requirements, so you will
need to implement them additionally.

### To what extent is HarmonyOS NEXT supported?

All of the core developer resides outside China and does not possess
the actual hardware sold in China. Consequently, functionality has
only been verified using an emulator.

### Can you reproduce "2.5-4.5x times faster"? What are the measurement conditions?

This is a synthetic benchmark designed to measure the performance difference.

Measurement code:
```
func main() {
    var sum = 0;
    for(i in 0..10000) {
        for(j in 0..100000) {
            sum = sum + 1;
        }
    }
}
```

| Machine                 | JIT (s)      | Interpreter (s)       | Scaling (JIT vs Interpreter) |
|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Intel Core i9 12900H    | 3.32         | 13.2s                 | 4.0x                         |
| Intel Core Ultra 5 228V | 5.78s        | 15.6                  | 2.7x                         |
| Intel Xeon Silver 4114  | 8.08         | 36.4s                 | 4.5x                         |
| Apple M5                | 2.77         | 10.6s                 | 3.8x                         |
| IBM POWER8              | 43.719       | 117.8s                | 2.7x                         |

In a real game app, the performance difference may vary depending on
the your logic and the amount of script execution. However, we have
observed that in typical visual novel scenarios, the performance
improvement can be significant, often around 5x faster when using AOT
compared to the interpreter.

### Old GC takes 10 to 300ms, but does it cause frame drops?

The Old GC is rarely invoked. Large buffers like images are managed by
C and are properly freed manually. The targets for GC are strings and
dictionary objects in scripts, and the Old GC is not invoked unless
something unusual occurs.

### How do I start making games? Any samples?

Please see the
[Getting Started Guide](docs/mkdocs-en/docs/getting-started.md)
for a step-by-step guide to creating your first game with Suika3.
We also provide sample games in the `game/` directory of this
repository, which you can use as references or starting points for
your own projects.

### How do I go about developing plugins?

Please see the [Plugin Development Guide](docs/mkdocs-en/docs/plugin.md)
for detailed instructions on how to create plugins for Suika3.

### Can I migrate from existing assets (like Ren'Py or Unity)?

Only consider migration when targeting mobile is necessary and your
existing engine makes it difficult. Otherwise, migration may not be
worth the effort.

Images and audio can be migrated by batch converting their formats,
but the UI requires manual porting. Scenarios also need manual
porting, though AI could enable some degree of automated conversion.

### Where's the document? Is it the latest version?

See [Documentation](docs/mkdocs-en/docs/index.md) for the latest
documentation.

### Is Japanese/Chinese/... supported?

Games are Unicode compliant, so you can use any language that does not
use Unicode composition in your game content. The engine itself is
internationalized, and error messages are shown in local languages.

For Japanese and CJK games, Suika3 supports:
* Kinsoku characters including line breaking rules
* Ruby annotations
* Vertical writing

Note that Right-To-Left writing system is currently not implemented
yet because of the lack of the speakers in the development
team. Please contact the developers if you can help implementing it.

### Where should I go if I'm in trouble?

Please ask questions on GitHub or Discord. If you're unfamiliar with
GitHub and don't like Discord, email is fine too ;-)

### What about SLAs and maintenance contracts for businesses?

Please request the service level you require. For a contract covering
only bug fixes, the cost is typically around 100 USD per month. For a
comprehensive contract including feature additions, it is
approximately 5000 USD per game title. If you are based in an emerging
country and cannot cover these costs, please reach out to discuss
options.

### What are the minimum requirements?

### What does "Supported" mean?

This indicates that the sample game has passed the verification
process to ensure it runs on either the actual hardware or an
emulator.

It just means we have a working codebase for the platform, and you
need a final QA for your game.

### Will there be breaking changes? What is the compatibility policy?

No backward-breaking changes to API specification will be made to past
releases. Existing API functions will not be changed, and new APIs
will be added instead. If behavior must be altered, a flag will be
provided to configure the behavior mode. Note that save data
specifications may not be compatible across releases. For a single
product, please fix and lock the major release version to be used.

### Does it support DLC or in-app purchases?

No, it doesn't, and there are no plans to support them.

Instead, please assume a subscription-based distribution model, like
Apple Arcade. In this model, a visual novel becomes a work that is
read for a long time—much like a book—and is monetized through
continuous viewing and playtime, similar to YouTube videos.

The visual novel market on mobile cannot survive unless it adapts to
this long-tail distribution.

Even if the project is supported by a small number of core fans, I
recommend selling merchandise rather than relying on DLC. Additional
content should be provided as free app updates rather than being split
into paid segments; the work should always remain a single, unified
experience.

At present, this remains a forward-looking perspective. However,
in-app monetization models—particularly those resembling gambling
mechanics—may face increasing regulatory restrictions depending on
regional policies. It is possible that such regulations could expand
and become a broader global standard over time.

For this reason, building a business model that does not rely on
in-app purchases is not only a risk mitigation strategy, but also a
path toward more sustainable revenue. More importantly, it allows each
work to remain available, discoverable, and continuously
played—enabling it to be appreciated and loved over the long term.

Furthermore, platform holders are the core of distribution and
essential business partners. On mobile and consoles, it’s necessary
to design projects based not only on "what you want to create" but
also on "what kind of experience the platformer expects." This might
seem like a different dimension from pure artistic creation. However,
as a professional creator, this is an indispensable process for
delivering your work sustainably.

Game subscription services are still an emerging and evolving
market. By contributing to its growth at this stage, creators are well
positioned to build strong relationships with platform holders and
benefit from increased visibility and support. Early participation in
shaping the ecosystem is likely to be rewarded as the market matures.

This is the core strategy of the Suika3 project.
