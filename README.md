A next-generation cross-platform visual novel engine designed for the 2030s and beyond.

Suika3 is a high-performance, rock-solid visual novel engine developed by the `Suika3 Community`.

Engineered with state-of-the-art techniques in computer science,
Suika3 delivers blazing speed, native performance, and true portability
empowering creators worldwide to build timeless experiences that endure for decades.

Games made with Suika3 are powered by `NovelML 3.0` and `SuikaScript 3.0`.

* **NovelML 3.0**: A tag-based, human-readable markup language
  designed specifically for visual novels. It features concise,
  declarative tags for seamless dialogue and scene
  control. Developers can also extend its capabilities by defining
  custom tags using SuikaScript.

* **SuikaScript 3.0**: The robust extension language for Suika3. It
  utilizes a high-speed JIT compiler on desktop platforms and can be
  compiled into native binaries for production or mobile
  environments.

## Why SuikaScript?

* **Instant Iteration:** No compile cycles, no waiting. The built-in
    JIT compiler runs your scripts immediately after editing, so you
    can tweak gameplay and see results in real-time.
* **True Native Performance:** Run extensions at full speed on iOS,
    Android, and consoles. Even on platforms where JIT is restricted,
    you never have to sacrifice performance.
* **Smooth Store Approval:** Dramatically lower the risk of
    rejection. Since final builds consist of native code via AOT,
    you'll breeze through App Store and console certifications.
* **Easy to Learn, Powerful to Use:** The JavaScript-inspired syntax
    is friendly for beginners, yet offers the deep flexibility
    seasoned developers expect for complex systems.
* **Long-term Stability:** Because we develop the language in-house,
    you're shielded from breaking changes in upstream projects. We own
    and control the full stack, so your scripts stay compatible forever.

Yes, it's OUR language, built just for devs like you ;-)

## Our Philosophy

Suika3 is dedicated to creators who dream of publishing and selling
original visual novels on the App Store and Google Play, regardless of
their hardware limitations.

Our mission is to empower talent—particularly in Asia and the Global
South—to build sustainable careers through their storytelling. We
believe that with the right tools, creativity can overcome economic
barriers.

Our commitment to free software is rooted in a simple, practical goal:
fostering sustainable economic independence. This mission is shaped by
our core members' personal experiences in Asia and their journeys in
overcoming adversity. We simply believe that talent, when equipped
with the right tools, inevitably leads to self-reliance.

Creators with different goals may also find excellent resources in
other open-source projects or commercial engines like Unity.

## Technical Overview

If you were shocked after reading this section, you're a real engineer ;-)

Suika3 is not merely a wrapper around SDL combined with a scripting language.
It features its own rendering and audio backends, and its own scripting language,
positioning it as a fully independent game engine.

### Core Architecture

Suika3 is based on `PlayField Engine`, a comprehensive 2D game engine.
This means that Suika3 is fully extensible using the Playfield API.
(Can you believe that Playfield Engine was actually developed just for Suika3?)

```

* **Scripting**:
  Integrates [NoctLang](https://github.com/awemorris/NoctLang),
  a tiny yet mighty language designed for game scripting.

* **Rendering**:
  Supports native DirectX 9/11/12, Metal, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, and WebGL for wide compatibility.

* **Audio**:
  Provides lightweight audio support through native DirectSound or XAudio2 (Windows),
  Audio Unit (macOS/iOS), ALSA (Linux), OSS (BSD), and other APIs.

### StratoHAL

StratoHAL originated as the codebase of a 2D game engine developed since 2001,
and has been open-sourced with a proven record of exceptional stability.
Evolving over a quarter century from the Windows 9x era,
StratoHAL has grown to support macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, WebAssembly, and Unity.
It has been running reliably on smartphones for more than a decade.
While SDL3 already exists as a popular open-source alternative,
StratoHAL covers the same major platforms as SDL3 — and uniquely provides console support through Unity without relying on any NDA-restricted code.

### Console Unity Plugin Notice

Playfield Engine provides Unity Plugin binaries for platforms
including Windows 64-bit and game consoles.  These binaries are built
entirely with the open-source version of LLVM/Clang toolchain (no
proprietary SDKs).

For Xbox series, you can use the native Microsoft GDK port directly, not via Unity.

### NoctLang

```
SuikaScript = NoctLang + Suika3 API
```

**NoctLang** is a lightweight scripting language designed for in-app scripting.
With a game-oriented syntax, it emphasizes clarity, instant startup, and tight integration with the engine.

The built-in JIT compiler supports a wide range of CPU architectures, including:
* Intel x86 (32-bit)
* AMD64/x86_64 (64-bit)
* ARMv7 (32-bit)
* Arm64 (64-bit)
* RISC-V (32-bit/64-bit)
* PowerPC/POWER (32-bit/64-bit)
* MIPS (32-bit/64-bit)

For platforms where JIT is restricted (such as mobile or consoles),
NoctLang can fall back to interpreter mode, and AOT (ahead-of-time)
compilation using a C source backend — ensuring full compatibility
even in tightly controlled environments.

### Script Execution Mode

|Platform       |Mode               |
|---------------|-------------------|
|Windows x86    |JIT                |
|Windows x64    |JIT                |
|Windows arm64  |JIT                |
|macOS x86_64   |JIT                |
|macOS arm64    |JIT                |
|Linux x86      |JIT                |
|Linux x86_64   |JIT                |
|Linux armv7    |JIT                |
|Linux arm64    |JIT                |
|iOS            |Interpreter or AOT |
|Android ARMv7  |Interpreter or AOT |
|Android Arm64  |Interpreter or AOT |
|WebAssembly    |Interpreter or AOT |
|Unity Plugin   |Interpreter or AOT |
|Xbox           |Interpreter or AOT |
|FreeBSD        |JIT                |
|NetBSD         |JIT                |
|OpebBSD        |Interpreter or AOT |

### Runtime Footprint

|Platform       |Binary Size    |Memory Usage (GC)                                              |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|All targets    |~2 MB          |Allocates 256 MB at startup for GC; does not exceed that limit |

The garbage collector allocates 256 MB at startup because currently 256 MB is the maximum heap size.
So the required system memory size is 256 MB by default.
(However, this can be adjusted to a smaller value.)

## Garbage Collection (GC) in Suika3

Suika3 features a high-performance generational garbage collector,
inspired by the architecture of the Java HotSpot VM. This design
ensures that developers can focus on creation without being
interrupted by the dreaded "GC spikes" or frame drops.

### Core Mechanism: Generational GC

The system categorizes objects into two groups to optimize memory
management:

* Young Generation: Most objects die young. Suika3 handles these using
  a high-speed Copying Algorithm (Semi-space Copy GC), which clears
  out temporary data in a flash. (typically < 0.1ms)
* Old Generation: Long-lived objects are moved here. This area uses a
  Mark-Sweep-Compact GC algorithm, which periodically reorganizes
  memory to prevent fragmentation. (typically 10-300ms)

### Frame-Synchronized Latency Hiding

The real "magic" of Suika3 lies in its timing. By executing the
Young-generation Copy GC every single frame, the system effectively
hides the GC processing time within the natural frame interval.

Thanks to this generational strategy, the heavier Old-generation
Mark-and-Sweep is rarely triggered, maintaining a silky-smooth
experience for the player.

---

## Codebase & Maturity

Suika3 is a robust visual novel engine with over 100k lines of code (LoC).
This isn't a weekend project, but a "matured" codebase evolved over 25+ years.

* **Proven Stability:** Includes core logic refined since 2001.
* **Modern Architecture:** Features a clean HAL (Hardware Abstraction
    Layer) separated in 2016 and high-performance GPU rendering
    implemented in 2022.
* **Native Multi-Platform:** Built mostly with C, and the platform
    native languages, including C++ (DirectX), Swift (macOS/iOS),
    Objective-C (macOS/iOS), C# (Unity) and Shaders (HLSL/GLSL/Metal).

---

## Quality Assurance

Reliability is a function of time. As Suika3 is currently in its
pre-release phase, we define its cumulative operational time as
zero. Consequently, formal quality metrics are not yet applicable.

### Our Path to Stability

We are committed to delivering a production-grade engine. Our QA
roadmap is as follows:

1.  **Release Candidate (RC) Phase**: Upon reaching the RC milestone,
    we will initiate rigorous tracking of all identified issues.

2.  **Data-Driven Hardening**: We will analyze bug discovery and
    resolution rates to quantify the software's stability.

3.  **Commercial-Grade Standards**: Our final goal is to achieve a
    level of robustness that meets the requirements of commercial
    visual novel productions.

While the engine is still "young" in terms of uptime, the underlying
architecture inherits over two decades of development philosophy,
ensuring a solid foundation for the upcoming QA process.

## Lineage: The Grand Journey

Suika3 represents the culmination of over two decades of relentless innovation and development:

* **Suika Studio (2001–2004)**: The origin of our codebase, featuring our first GUI-based editors. 
* **Unfruitiful (2005–2015)**: A decade of R&D focused on establishing a robust portability layer for cross-platform support.
* **Suika2 (2016–2024)**: The cornerstone of our current architecture and the fruit of a decade of dedicated R&D.
  It delivers a full visual novel experience with extensive platform compatibility.
* **Playfield Engine (2025–)**: A versatile 2D engine derived from the core portability layer of the Suika series.
* **Suika3 (2026–)**: By synthesizing these legacies and introducing **NovelML 3.0 / SuikaScript 3.0**,
  Suika3 delivers the rock-solid stability of its predecessors alongside the cutting-edge flexibility of modern technology.
