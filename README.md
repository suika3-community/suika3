Suika3
======

The next-generation visual novel engine for the 2030s and beyond.

`Suika3` is a high-performance visual novel engine developed by the
`Suika3 Community`. Built to be fast, native, and truly universal,
Suika3 aims to empower creators across the globe for the decades to
come.

Games made with Suika3 run on the `Suika JIT Virtual Machine` (VM).
The VM executes `Suika NovelML` along with `Suika SeedScript`.

NovelML is a tag-based markup language for visual novels. It is very
intuitive for developers with experience with other engines.

SeedScript is our original scripting language that runs at true native
speed within the VM. Inspired by JavaScript, SeedScript offers a
streamlined syntax that is more intuitive for beginners yet powerful
enough for seasoned developers.

## Status: Work in Progress

This repository is currently under active development. Features and
APIs are subject to change.

## Lineage: The Grand Journey

Suika3 represents the culmination of over two decades of relentless innovation and development:

* **Suika Studio (2001–2004)**: The origin of our codebase, featuring our first GUI-based editors. Inspired by the legendary AGES engine.
* **Unfruitiful (2005–2015)**: A decade of R&D focused on establishing a robust portability layer for cross-platform support.
* **Suika2 (2016–2024)**: The cornerstone of our current architecture and the fruit of a decade of dedicated R&D.
  It delivers a full visual novel experience with extensive platform compatibility.
* **Playfield Engine (2025)**: A versatile 2D engine derived from the core portability layer of the Suika series.
* **Suika3 (2026–)**: By synthesizing these legacies and introducing **NovelML/SeedScript**,
  Suika3 delivers the rock-solid stability of its predecessors alongside the cutting-edge flexibility of modern technology.

## Manifesto

### Stories Belong to Everyone.

We believe that storytelling is one of humanity's most powerful forms
of recording information. Creating and sharing stories should not be a
privilege reserved for the few — it is a fundamental human right.

### Accessibility Without Borders.

Creative tools should be open and accessible to all, regardless of
wealth, geography, or hardware. Suika3 is intentionally engineered to
run smoothly on entry-level, affordable PCs. Your creativity should
never be limited by the price tag of your hardware.

### Empowering Creators Worldwide.

We envision a world where you can develop for platforms you've never
even touched, reaching audiences far beyond your immediate
environment. By empowering creators, we aim to foster an open
ecosystem where:

* **Players** are emotionally enriched by a diverse tapestry of stories.
* **Developers** can sustain themselves both creatively and economically.

This is more than just software. This is an invitation to create.
