Suika3
======

The next-generation visual novel engine for the 2030s and beyond.

`Suika3` is a high-performance visual novel engine developed by the
`Suika3 Community`. Built to be fast, native, and truly universal,
Suika3 aims to empower creators across the globe for the decades to
come.

Games made with Suika3 run on the `Suika3 JIT Virtual Machine` (VM).
The VM executes `NovelML 3.0` along with `SeedScript 3.0`.

`NovelML 3.0` is a tag-based, human-readable markup for visual novels.
Familiar to developers from other engines, it uses concise, declarative tags
for dialogue and scenes, so scripts are readable at a glance.

`SeedScript 3.0` is our original scripting language that runs at true native
speed within the VM. Inspired by JavaScript, SeedScript offers a
streamlined syntax that is more intuitive for beginners yet powerful
enough for seasoned developers. Because both the language and VM are
developed in-house, you never have to worry about being left behind by
upstream language updates or breaking changes. Your scripts will remain
stable and compatible for the long term.

## Status: Work in Progress

This repository is currently under active development. Features and
APIs are subject to change.

## Key Features

* **High Performance**: Powered by the Suika JIT VM, it delivers unparalleled execution speed.
* **Lightweight**: Engineered to run smoothly even on low-spec hardware and in developing regions.
* **Universal Platform**: Designed with a "port anywhere" strategy, ensuring compatibility with almost every modern platform.
* **Extensible**: NovelML can be seamlessly expanded by developers using SeedScript.
* **Reliable**: Built on the proven codebase of Suika2 and integrated with the modern Playfield Engine.
* **Jot-and-Run**: A powerful markup language designed to bring your stories to life in an instant.

## Getting Started

A quick path to try Suika3 locally.

### Using prebuilt binary

Please download from [Releases](releases).

### Building locally

Refer to [build.md](docs/mkdocs-en/build.md) (when available) for platform-specific instructions.

```
git clone https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3.git
cd suika3
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
cp -R ../game/* .
./suika3
```

## Quick Start

`start.novel` file looks like:
```
# Show a background image.
[bg file="bg/coast.png" time="0.5"]

# Show a character image.
[ch center="ch/midori-normal.png" time="0.5" fade="normal"]

# Show a question text.
[text text="Choose a name."]

# Show options.
[choose
  name="choose_result"
  text1="March"
  text2="April"
  text3="May"
]

# Branch by the choose's result.
[if lhs="${choose_result}" op="==" rhs="March"]
    [set name="name" value="March"]
[elseif lhs="${choose_result}" op="==" rhs="April"]
    [set name="name" value="April"]
[else]
    [set name="name" value="May"]
[endif]

# Show a text.
[text name="${name}" text="Hello! My name is ${name}."]
```

`main.pf` file looks like:
```
// Called when the window is opened.
func setup() {
    // Return the window settings.
    return {
        width:      1280,
        height:     720,
        title:      "My First Game",
	fullscreen: false
    };
}

// Called before the game starts.
func start() {
    // Do not delete the following line.
    Suika.start();
}

// Called before a frame rendering.
func update() {
    // Do not delete the following line.
    Suika.update();
}

// Called every frame rendering.
func render() {
    // Do not delete the following line.
    Suika.render();
}
```

## Lineage: The Grand Journey

Suika3 represents the culmination of over two decades of relentless innovation and development:

* **Suika Studio (2001–2004)**: The origin of our codebase, featuring our first GUI-based editors. 
* **Unfruitiful (2005–2015)**: A decade of R&D focused on establishing a robust portability layer for cross-platform support.
* **Suika2 (2016–2024)**: The cornerstone of our current architecture and the fruit of a decade of dedicated R&D.
  It delivers a full visual novel experience with extensive platform compatibility.
* **Playfield Engine (2025–)**: A versatile 2D engine derived from the core portability layer of the Suika series.
* **Suika3 (2026–)**: By synthesizing these legacies and introducing **NovelML 3.0 / SeedScript 3.0**,
  Suika3 delivers the rock-solid stability of its predecessors alongside the cutting-edge flexibility of modern technology.

## Technical Overview

Suika3 is not merely a wrapper around SDL combined with a scripting language.
It features its own rendering and audio backends, and its own scripting language,
positioning it as a fully independent game engine.

### Core Architecture

Suika3 is based on `PlayField Engine`, a comprehensive 2D game engine.
This means that Suika3 is fully extensible using the Playfield API.
(Did you know that Playfield Engine was actually developed for Suika3?)

```
+-----------------------+
|        Suika3         |
+-----------------------+
|    Playfield Engine   |
+-----------+-----------+
| StratoHAL | NoctLang  |
+-----------+-----------+
|   Operating System    |
+-----------------------+
```

* **Scripting**:
  Integrates [NoctLang](https://github.com/awemorris/NoctLang),
  a tiny yet mighty language designed for game scripting.

* **Rendering**:
  Supports native DirectX 9/11/12, Metal, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, and WebGL for wide compatibility.

* **Audio**:
  Provides lightweight audio support through native DirectSound or XAudio2 (Windows),
  Audio Unit (macOS/iOS), ALSA (Linux), OSS (BSD), and other APIs.

### StratoHAL

StratoHAL originated as the codebase of a 2D game engine developed since 2001,
and has been open-sourced with a proven record of exceptional stability.
Evolving over a quarter century from the Windows 9x era,
StratoHAL has grown to support macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, WebAssembly, and Unity.
It has been running reliably on smartphones for more than a decade.
While SDL3 already exists as a popular open-source alternative,
StratoHAL covers the same major platforms as SDL3 — and uniquely provides console support through Unity without relying on any NDA-restricted code.

### Platform Support and Comonents

|Platform Type  |OS / Platform       |Graphics                 |Sound                 |SDK                  |

|               |Xbox Series X\|S    |DirectX 12               |XAudio2 (GDK)         |Microsft GDK         |

### Console Unity Plugin Notice

Playfield Engine provides Unity Plugin binaries for platforms
including Windows 64-bit and game consoles.  These binaries are built
entirely with the open-source version of LLVM/Clang toolchain (no
proprietary SDKs).

For Xbox series, you can use the native Microsoft GDK port directly, not via Unity.

### NoctLang

```
SeedScript = NoctLang + Suika3 API
```

**NoctLang** is a lightweight scripting language designed for in-app scripting.
With a game-oriented syntax, it emphasizes clarity, instant startup, and tight integration with the engine.

The built-in JIT compiler supports a wide range of CPU architectures,
including both 32-bit and 64-bit of: **Intel, Arm, RISC-V, PowerPC, MIPS.**

For platforms where JIT is restricted (such as mobile or consoles),
NoctLang can fall back to interpreter mode, and AOT (ahead-of-time)
compilation using a C source backend — ensuring full compatibility
even in tightly controlled environments.

### Script Execution Mode

|Platform       |Mode               |
|---------------|-------------------|
|Windows x86    |JIT                |
|Windows x64    |JIT                |
|Windows arm64  |JIT                |
|macOS x86_64   |JIT                |
|macOS arm64    |JIT                |
|Linux x86      |JIT                |
|Linux x86_64   |JIT                |
|Linux armv7    |JIT                |
|Linux arm64    |JIT                |
|FreeBSD x86_64 |JIT                |
|iOS            |Interpreter or AOT |
|Android        |Interpreter or AOT |
|WebAssembly    |Interpreter or AOT |
|Unity Plugin   |Interpreter or AOT |
|Xbox           |Interpreter or AOT |

### Runtime Footprint

|Platform       |Binary Size    |Memory Usage (GC)                                              |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|All targets    |~2 MB          |Allocates 256 MB at startup for GC; does not exceed that limit |

The garbage collector allocates 256 MB at startup because currently 256 MB is the maximum heap size.

### Garbage Collection

Suika3 implements a high-performance garbage collector similar to the
HotSpot VM in Java, so you generally don’t need to worry much about
delays caused by garbage collection.

* The garbage collector uses a generational GC, managing objects in young and old generations.
* Young-generation GC runs extremely fast using a copying algorithm (semi-space copy GC).
* Old-generation GC uses a mark-and-sweep algorithm and performs compaction when necessary (mark-sweep-compact GC).
