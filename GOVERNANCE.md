Governance
==========

This document describes how the Suika3 project is governed, how
decisions are made, and how contributors can participate in shaping
its future.

Suika3 is a community-driven open source project. Its governance is
designed to balance openness, trust, and long-term sustainability.

* **Community-first**  
  Suika3 exists for its community of creators, contributors, and
  players.

* **Long-term sustainability**  
  Decisions prioritize maintainability, clarity, and stability over
  short-term gains.

* **Open discussion, responsible decisions**  
  Everyone is encouraged to participate in discussions, while final
  decisions are made with responsibility and care.

* **Respect for diversity**  
  Cultural, technical, and experiential diversity is a strength of
  this project.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Maintainers

Maintainers are trusted contributors responsible for the health and
direction of the project.

Their responsibilities include:
* Reviewing and merging pull requests
* Managing releases and project milestones
* Moderating discussions and enforcing the Code of Conduct
* Making final decisions when consensus cannot be reached

Maintainers are expected to act in the best interest of the project
and its community.

---

### Contributors

Contributors are anyone who participates in the project, including
code, documentation, testing, design, and discussion.

Contributors are encouraged to:
* Propose changes and ideas openly
* Participate respectfully in discussions
* Help review and improve contributions from others

There is no formal hierarchy among contributors.

---

## Decision-Making Process

### Consensus Seeking

Most decisions are made through open discussion in issues, pull
requests, or discussions.

Consensus does not require unanimous agreement, but it does require
that concerns are heard, discussed, and reasonably addressed.

---

### Maintainer Decisions

When consensus cannot be reached, maintainers may make a final
decision.

Such decisions should:
* Be clearly explained
* Reference the discussion and trade-offs involved
* Prioritize the long-term health of the project

---

## Project Direction and Scope

The maintainers are responsible for defining and maintaining the
overall direction of Suika3.

This includes:
* Architectural principles
* Supported platforms
* Performance and accessibility goals
* Compatibility and migration policies

Large changes to direction should be discussed publicly before
implementation.

---

## Becoming a Maintainer

Maintainers are selected based on:
* Consistent, high-quality contributions
* Understanding of Suika3’s values and architecture
* Demonstrated respect and collaboration within the community

There is no automatic promotion. New maintainers are invited by
existing maintainers through consensus.

---

## Conflict Resolution

In the event of conflict:

1. Participants are encouraged to resolve issues through calm and
   respectful discussion.
2. Maintainers may mediate if needed.
3. If necessary, maintainers may take action in accordance with the
   Code of Conduct.

The goal of conflict resolution is restoration of trust, not
punishment.

---

## Changes to This Document

This governance document may evolve as the project grows.

Proposed changes should be discussed openly and approved by the
maintainers.

---

## Closing

Suika3 is built on trust, shared responsibility, and a belief in the
power of creation.

Governance exists not to control the community, but to support it —
so that Suika3 can continue to grow for decades to come.
